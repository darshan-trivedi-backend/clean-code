# **Unit Tests: Simplified Notes**

## **1. Evolution of Unit Testing**
- **Before**: In the 1990s, tests were ad hoc, manually written, and often thrown away after use.
- **Now**: Automated unit tests are central to maintaining clean and robust code, allowing for Test-Driven Development (TDD).

---

## **2. The Three Laws of TDD**
1. **First Law**: Write a failing test before writing any production code.
2. **Second Law**: Write only enough test to make it fail (compilation failure counts).
3. **Third Law**: Write only enough production code to make the failing test pass.

These rules create a fast feedback cycle (about 30 seconds) and ensure both tests and code evolve together.

---

## **3. Importance of Clean Tests**
- **Clean Tests = Maintainable Code**: Messy tests make it hard to modify production code as the project evolves.
- **Key Insight**: Dirty tests can lead to failure of the entire testing process, making them worse than no tests at all.
- **Solution**: Treat test code as a first-class citizenâ€”apply the same standards as production code.

---

## **4. Tests Enable the -ilities**
- Tests make your code **flexible**, **maintainable**, and **reusable** by reducing fear of changes.
- Without tests, every change risks introducing bugs, leading to code rot.

---

## **5. Characteristics of Clean Tests**
### **A. Readability**
- Readability is the most important quality of clean tests.
- Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

### **B. Eliminate Obfuscation**
- Remove unnecessary details that distract from the intent of the test.

### **Example: Refactoring Tests**
**Before (Messy and Detailed)**:
```java
public void testGetPageHierarchyAsXml() throws Exception {
    crawler.addPage(root, PathParser.parse("PageOne"));
    crawler.addPage(root, PathParser.parse("PageOne.ChildOne"));
    crawler.addPage(root, PathParser.parse("PageTwo"));
    request.setResource("root");
    request.addInput("type", "pages");
    Responder responder = new SerializedPageResponder();
    SimpleResponse response = (SimpleResponse) responder.makeResponse(new FitNesseContext(root), request);
    String xml = response.getContent();
    assertEquals("text/xml", response.getContentType());
    assertSubString("<name>PageOne</name>", xml);
    assertSubString("<name>PageTwo</name>", xml);
    assertSubString("<name>ChildOne</name>", xml);
}
```

**After (Clean and Expressive)**:
```java
public void testGetPageHierarchyAsXml() throws Exception {
    makePages("PageOne", "PageOne.ChildOne", "PageTwo");
    submitRequest("root", "type:pages");
    assertResponseIsXML();
    assertResponseContains("<name>PageOne</name>", "<name>PageTwo</name>", "<name>ChildOne</name>");
}
```
- Refactor helper functions like `makePages`, `submitRequest`, and `assertResponseIsXML` into a domain-specific testing language.

---

## **6. Domain-Specific Testing Language**
- Build reusable testing utilities to simplify test creation.
- Example:
  ```java
  public void testTurnOnCoolerIfTooHot() throws Exception {
      tooHot();
      assertEquals("hBChl", hw.getState());
  }
  ```
  Here, the `tooHot()` function abstracts unnecessary details, making the test readable.

---

## **7. Rules for Effective Testing**
### **A. Single Concept per Test**
- Test only **one concept** in each function.
- Avoid testing unrelated scenarios in the same test.

### **B. F.I.R.S.T. Principles**
1. **Fast**: Tests should run quickly to encourage frequent execution.
2. **Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other.
3. **Repeatable**: Tests must produce the same result in any environment.
4. **Self-Validating**: Tests should output a simple pass/fail result.
5. **Timely**: Write tests just before writing the production code they validate.

---

## **8. One Assert per Test**
- **Guideline**: Each test should ideally have a single assert.
- However, multiple asserts are acceptable if they test one concept.

### **Example (Using One Assert)**:
```java
public void testResponseIsXml() throws Exception {
    givenPages("PageOne", "PageTwo");
    whenRequestIsIssued("root", "type:pages");
    thenResponseShouldBeXML();
}

public void testResponseContainsCorrectTags() throws Exception {
    givenPages("PageOne", "PageTwo");
    whenRequestIsIssued("root", "type:pages");
    thenResponseShouldContain("<name>PageOne</name>", "<name>PageTwo</name>");
}
```

---

## **9. Avoid Mental Mapping**
- Tests should be self-explanatory, without requiring the reader to decode complex patterns.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  assertEquals("HBchl", hw.getState());
  ```
  This is acceptable if the meaning of "HBchl" (Heater: On, Blower: On, Cooler: Off, etc.) is well-documented.

---

## **10. Conclusion**
- Unit tests are critical for maintaining clean, flexible, and bug-free production code.
- Keep your tests:
  1. **Readable**.
  2. **Focused on a single concept**.
  3. **Fast and repeatable**.
- **Key Insight**: If tests rot, your production code will rot too. Keep them clean to ensure long-term success.
