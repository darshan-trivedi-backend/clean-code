# **Boundaries: Simplified Notes**

## **1. Understanding Boundaries**
- Boundaries occur where your code interacts with third-party libraries, external APIs, or other teams' components.
- **Goal**: Keep these interactions clean and manageable to minimize issues caused by external changes or unknowns.

---

## **2. Using Third-Party Code**
- **Problem**: Third-party libraries are designed for broad use, often exposing more functionality than you need (e.g., `java.util.Map`).
- **Solution**: Encapsulate third-party APIs to:
  - Simplify usage.
  - Constrain functionality.
  - Protect your code from external changes.

### **Example: Encapsulating `Map`**
**Bad Example (Direct Use of `Map`)**:
```java
Map sensors = new HashMap();
Sensor s = (Sensor) sensors.get(sensorId);  // Repeated casting
```

**Good Example (Encapsulated Usage)**:
```java
public class Sensors {
    private Map<String, Sensor> sensors = new HashMap<>();

    public Sensor getById(String id) {
        return sensors.get(id);
    }
}
```
Benefits:
- Type safety (no manual casting).
- Easy to change the internal implementation (e.g., replace `Map` with another data structure).

## **3. Exploring and Learning Boundaries**
- **Learning Tests**:
  - Write tests to explore and understand third-party APIs before integrating them.
  - These tests act as **controlled experiments** to ensure you’re using the API correctly.

### **Example: Learning Tests for Log4j**
**Step-by-Step Exploration**:
1. **Basic Test**:
    ```java
    @Test
    public void testLogCreate() {
        Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
        logger.info("hello");
    }
    ```
2. **Adding an Appender**:
    ```java
    @Test
    public void testLogAddAppender() {
        Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
        ConsoleAppender appender = new ConsoleAppender();
        logger.addAppender(appender);
        logger.info("hello");
    }
    ```
3. **Final Refined Test**:
    ```java
    @Test
    public void testLogWithStream() {
        Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");
        logger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(
            new PatternLayout("%p %t %m%n"), ConsoleAppender.SYSTEM_OUT));
        logger.info("hello");
    }
    ```

Benefits of Learning Tests:
- Help you understand the API.
- Catch issues when the library is updated.
- Provide documentation on how your code interacts with third-party components.

---

## **4. Using Code That Doesn’t Exist Yet**
- When the API or implementation is undefined or incomplete:
  - **Define your own interface** to act as a placeholder.
  - This lets you continue development without being blocked.

### **Example: Placeholder Interface**
**Unknown API (Transmitter)**:
```java
public interface Transmitter {
    void transmit(double frequency, InputStream data);
}
```
**Usage in Client Code**:
```java
public class CommunicationsController {
    private Transmitter transmitter;

    public void sendSignal(double frequency, InputStream data) {
        transmitter.transmit(frequency, data);
    }
}
```
Once the real API is ready, you can write an adapter:
```java
public class TransmitterAdapter implements Transmitter {
    private final TransmitterAPI transmitterAPI;

    @Override
    public void transmit(double frequency, InputStream data) {
        transmitterAPI.keyOn(frequency);
        transmitterAPI.sendData(data);
    }
}
```

Benefits:
- Keeps your code clean and focused.
- Reduces dependency on an undefined or external API.

## **5. Clean Boundaries**
### **Best Practices for Managing Boundaries**:
1. **Encapsulation**: Wrap third-party APIs in your own abstractions.
   - Example: Encapsulating `Map` inside a `Sensors` class.
2. **Adapters**: Use an Adapter pattern to bridge your interface with the external API.
   - Example: `TransmitterAdapter` for the `TransmitterAPI`.
3. **Minimize Exposure**:
   - Avoid passing third-party interfaces like `Map` or `Logger` directly in your system.
   - Use encapsulation or adapters to shield your code from changes.
4. **Boundary Tests**:
   - Write tests to verify how your code interacts with third-party libraries.
   - Helps detect breaking changes when libraries are updated.

## **6. Key Takeaways**
- **Protect Your Code**:
  - Depend on what you control, not directly on third-party APIs.
- **Keep Boundaries Clean**:
  - Encapsulate external code within your own interfaces.
- **Be Flexible**:
  - Use Adapters and placeholders to isolate changes and unknowns.
- **Learn and Test**:
  - Use learning tests to explore and validate third-party behavior.
- **Prepare for Change**:
  - Isolate boundary changes to specific, manageable parts of the code.
